# Sales Taxes!

*Last updated: March 24, 2021*

Taxes are an important part of functional society. Where our products are taxable, we collect and remit consumption tax to governments at the provincial and federal levels. If your billing address is in one of the following jurisdictions, you’ll see an *additional* line item on your invoice for sales tax. The subscription prices on our product websites are all exclusive of sales tax.

The tax rate and rules are determined by each jurisdiction. As regulations change, we will update this list.

## Jurisdictions we collect and remit taxes for

### Within Canada

We collect sales tax from [Calendarium](https://calendarium.ca/) subscribers based in:

* Quebec

## Updating your billing information

If you need to change your billing information because you don’t actually reside in a taxable jurisdiction, you can easily handle that within your accounts. You may need to re-enter your credit card information as part of the billing information update.
