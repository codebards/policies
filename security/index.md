# Security overview

*Last updated: March 24, 2021*

## We protect your data

All data you save are written to a database, on a solid state disk (SSD), and backed up daily.

## Your data are sent using HTTPS

Whenever your data are in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted, and sent using HTTPS.

Our application databases are encrypted at rest — the information you add to the applications is active in our databases and subject to the same protection and monitoring as the rest of our systems. Our database backups are encrypted.

## We protect your billing information

All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption — the same level of encryption used by leading banks. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI-Compliant network</a>.
